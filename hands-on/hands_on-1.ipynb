The platform's hybrid programming model allows computation on GPU, CPU, and QPU resources in tandem from within a single quantum program. CUDA-Q is “qubit-agnostic”—seamlessly integrating with all QPUs and qubit modalities and offering GPU-accelerated simulations when adequate quantum hardware isn't available.\n",

Under the hood, CUDA-Q can be interchangeably powered by industry-leading simulators or actual quantum processors from a growing list of vendors. Both of these engines can leverage AI supercomputing, whether to GPU-accelerate simulations or control and enhance QPU operations.\n",

Quantum kernels are defined as functions that are executed on a quantum processing unit (QPU) or a simulated QPU. Quantum kernels can be combined with classical functions to create quantum-classical applications that can be executed on a heterogeneous system of QPUs, GPUs, and CPUs to solve real-world problems."

        ">**CUDA-Q Quick Tip:** By default, when using the `cudaq.sample` execution mode, qubit measurements are conducted on the standard computational basis, which is along the $z$-axis.  In the cell block below, we have added the measurement explicitly with the `mz` command. There are other measurement options `mx` and `my` built into CUDA-Q that we'll experiment with in the next section. When we specify the measurement, instead of using the `cudaq.sample` execution mode, we switch to the `cudaq.run` execution mode.  To learn more about the differences between these execution modes, see the [documentation](https://nvidia.github.io/cuda-quantum/latest/using/examples/executing_kernels.html).\n",
        "\n",
        "Notice that the results from running the two kernels above differ from one another.  And thus, by switching to measurement with the `mx` command we are able to distinguish the $\\ket{+}$ and $\\ket{-}$ states. However, there is a drawback &#8212; measuring with `mx` doesn't allow us to distinguish $\\ket{0}$ from $\\ket{1}$, because of the Uncertainty Principle in quantum mechanics. Test this claim out for yourself by creating and running kernels for the $\\ket{0}$ and $\\ket{1}$ states using the `mx` measurements.\n",
        "\n",
        "What is happening when we take a measurement?  What distinguishes the `mz` command from the `mx` command?  Abstractly when we are measuring a state $\\ket{\\psi}=\\alpha\\ket{0}+\\beta\\ket{1}$ with `mz`, we are applying Born's rule to the state $\\ket{\\psi}$. This act of measurement will collapse the state to $\\ket{0}$, with a probability $|\\alpha|^2$  and will collapse the state of the qubit to  $\\ket{1}$ with probability $|\\beta|^2$. You can graphically visualize this collapse under a `mz` measurement on the Bloch sphere as projecting the state $\\ket{\\psi}$ onto the $z$ axis.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Analogously, when measuring with `mx` we will be collapsing our state $\\ket{\\psi}$ to either $\\ket{+}$ or $\\ket{-}$ along the $x$-axis of the Bloch sphere.  We can use Born's Rule for this measurement, too.  The only difference is now instead of writing $\\ket{\\psi}$ in terms of computational basis states $\\ket{0}$ and $\\ket{1}$, we'll find coefficients $\\gamma$ and $\\delta$ so that $\\ket{\\psi}=\\gamma\\ket{+}+\\delta\\ket{-}$. With the `mx`measurement, the probabilities of measuring a $0$ and $1$ are determined by $|\\gamma|^2$ and $|\\delta|^2$, respectively.\n",
        "So for the case of $\\ket{+}$, the probability of measuring $0$ with `mx` is $100\\%$, and for $\\ket{-}$ the probability of measuring a $1$ with `mx` is $100\\%$. Therefore, `mx` gives us a way to distinguish $\\ket{+}$ and $\\ket{-}$ with only one shot, assuming there is no noise.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the remainder of this series of labs, we'll only be measuring with `mz`.
